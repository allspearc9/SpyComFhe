# SpyComFhe

**SpyComFhe** is a privacy-preserving platform for the encrypted analysis of **historical espionage communications**.  
It allows historians and digital humanities researchers to perform **network analysis, topic modeling, and linguistic exploration** on historical intelligence messages‚Äîsuch as decoded telegrams or intercepted correspondence‚Äî**without exposing sensitive information** that may still be classified or personally identifiable.

Using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, SpyComFhe enables computation directly on encrypted archives, ensuring that even while performing deep text analysis, no one ‚Äî not even the researchers or system operators ‚Äî can access the original, unencrypted content.

---

## Background

Historical intelligence archives often contain **partially declassified but still sensitive communications**.  
These documents may include names of informants, operational details, or geopolitical content that remains sensitive even decades later.

Researchers face three fundamental barriers:

1. **Incomplete Declassification:**  
   Governments often redact portions of documents, leaving gaps in the record.

2. **Privacy Constraints:**  
   Certain names or regions cannot be disclosed publicly due to ongoing national security or personal privacy protections.

3. **Analytical Limitation:**  
   Texts cannot be shared across institutions for joint analysis without risking data exposure.

Traditional anonymization or redaction techniques **remove essential linguistic and structural cues**, weakening the analytical value of the material.  
SpyComFhe introduces a way to **analyze these archives collaboratively under encryption**, allowing knowledge discovery **without compromising secrecy**.

## Core Idea

SpyComFhe bridges the gap between **cryptographic protection** and **historical inquiry**.  
It allows scholars to perform computational humanities research ‚Äî including text mining, semantic clustering, and network reconstruction ‚Äî on **fully encrypted espionage archives**.

### The Key Innovation:
> Using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, SpyComFhe enables operations like word frequency counting, co-occurrence detection, and network graph computation **directly on ciphertexts**.

This means:
- Text data never exists in plaintext during analysis.  
- Researchers can compute meaningful statistics while respecting confidentiality.  
- The system can output **encrypted research findings**, which are only decrypted by authorized institutions for interpretation.

## Why FHE Matters

Historical espionage records often contain **living sensitivities** ‚Äî the identities of individuals, operational routes, or intelligence networks.  
Even when documents are decades old, uncontrolled exposure could cause diplomatic tension or ethical concerns.

Conventional encryption protects storage, but **not analysis**. Once decrypted for research, data becomes vulnerable again.  
**FHE** changes this paradigm by allowing computation to occur *while data remains encrypted*.

| Challenge | Traditional Method | FHE-Based Approach |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Need to analyze sensitive texts | Requires decryption for computation | Computation occurs on ciphertext |
| Data sharing between archives | Insecure or limited | Encrypted data can be shared safely |
| Protection of personal identifiers | Requires redaction | Encryption prevents visibility entirely |
| Preservation of analytical accuracy | Reduced by anonymization | Preserved under exact encrypted computation |

By integrating FHE, **SpyComFhe** empowers researchers to uncover linguistic and relational structures while preserving confidentiality and respecting archival ethics.

## Architecture

### 1. Encrypted Data Layer
- Historical communications are encrypted locally by data custodians using the **FHE public key**.  
- Encryption covers both text and metadata (sender, recipient, date, content).  
- Each document is assigned a cryptographic hash for integrity verification.

### 2. FHE Computation Engine
- Performs mathematical operations directly on ciphertext.  
- Supports text vectorization, frequency analysis, co-occurrence computation, and graph generation under encryption.  
- Uses modular arithmetic and encrypted polynomial evaluation to compute linguistic metrics securely.

### 3. Analysis Orchestrator
- Defines workflows for encrypted corpus analysis:
  - Keyword extraction  
  - Topic clustering  
  - Graph reconstruction  
  - Sentiment or tone detection (if applicable)  
- Coordinates multi-institution computation while ensuring no plaintext data exposure.

### 4. Decryption and Interpretation Layer
- Only aggregated, non-sensitive results are decrypted by authorized historians.  
- Decryption keys remain under institutional control and are never centralized.  
- Produces interpretable summaries while raw encrypted data stays protected.

## Example Applications

### 1. Analyzing World War II Telegrams
Encrypted telegram datasets from different intelligence archives can be analyzed jointly to reconstruct encrypted communication patterns, identify recurring topics, or study message flows without revealing personal details.

### 2. Cold War Network Mapping
Encrypted co-occurrence analysis can reveal hidden clusters of communication between agents or embassies. The network topology is extracted without decrypting node identities.

### 3. Code Language and Phrase Study
Encrypted linguistic frequency models allow study of recurring words or codenames while preserving their confidentiality.

### 4. Comparative Archival Research
Different national archives can perform joint FHE computations to compare encrypted patterns across their datasets ‚Äî unlocking new historical insights without data exchange.

## Security and Trust Model

| Security Principle | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Data Confidentiality | FHE ensures no plaintext data is exposed during analysis |
| Institutional Sovereignty | Each archive controls its encryption keys |
| Non-Collusion Assurance | Encrypted computations produce verifiable proofs |
| Integrity Verification | Cryptographic hashes ensure document authenticity |
| Controlled Decryption | Only aggregate results are decrypted collaboratively |

SpyComFhe ensures that **no plaintext ever leaves an archive** and **no external researcher gains raw access** to sensitive materials.
